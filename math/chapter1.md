# Chapter 1: Computations with Integers

## What: Understanding Integers

### What are Integers?
Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. They do not include fractions or decimals. Examples of integers include -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, etc.

### Why Study Integers?
Integers are fundamental in mathematics because they form the basis for more complex operations and concepts. Understanding integers helps in:
- Solving basic arithmetic problems.
- Understanding algebraic expressions.
- Applying mathematical concepts in real-world scenarios.

## How: Operations with Integers

### 1A: Adding and Subtracting Positive Integers

#### How to Add Positive Integers
- **Step 1:** Write down the numbers you want to add.
- **Step 2:** Combine the numbers.
- **Step 3:** The result is the sum of the numbers.

**Example:**
- \( 5 + 3 = 8 \)

#### How to Subtract Positive Integers
- **Step 1:** Write down the numbers you want to subtract.
- **Step 2:** Subtract the second number from the first number.
- **Step 3:** The result is the difference of the numbers.

**Example:**
- \( 7 - 2 = 5 \)

### 1B: Multiplying and Dividing Positive Integers

#### How to Multiply Positive Integers
- **Step 1:** Write down the numbers you want to multiply.
- **Step 2:** Multiply the numbers.
- **Step 3:** The result is the product of the numbers.

**Example:**
- \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \)

#### How to Divide Positive Integers
- **Step 1:** Write down the numbers you want to divide.
- **Step 2:** Divide the first number by the second number.
- **Step 3:** The result is the quotient of the numbers.

**Example:**
- \( 12 \div 4 = 3 \)

### 1C: Number Properties

#### How to Apply Number Properties
- **Commutative Property:** The order of numbers does not change the result.
  - **Example:** \( 2 + 3 = 3 + 2 \)
- **Associative Property:** The grouping of numbers does not change the result.
  - **Example:** \( (2 + 3) + 4 = 2 + (3 + 4) \)
- **Distributive Property:** Multiplying a sum by a number is the same as multiplying each addend by the number and then adding the products.
  - **Example:** \( 2 \times (3 + 4) = 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 \)

### 1D: Divisibility and Prime Factorization

#### How to Determine Divisibility
- **Divisibility Rules:**
  - A number is divisible by 2 if it ends in an even number.
  - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
  - A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.

**Example:**
- Is 12 divisible by 3? Yes, because \( 1 + 2 = 3 \) and 3 is divisible by 3.

#### How to Perform Prime Factorization
- **Step 1:** Find the smallest prime number that divides the given number.
- **Step 2:** Divide the number by this prime number.
- **Step 3:** Repeat the process with the quotient until the quotient is a prime number.

**Example:**
- Prime factorization of 12: \( 12 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \)

## Why: Importance of Integers in Real Life

### Real-Life Applications
- **Finance:** Understanding integers helps in managing budgets, calculating expenses, and tracking income.
- **Engineering:** Engineers use integers to calculate measurements, forces, and distances.
- **Science:** Scientists use integers in experiments, data analysis, and measurements.

### Building a Strong Foundation
- **Algebra:** Integers are the basis for algebraic expressions and equations.
- **Geometry:** Integers are used in coordinate systems and measurements.
- **Statistics:** Integers are used in data collection and analysis.
